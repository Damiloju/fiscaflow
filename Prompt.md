**User**: "2025/06/24 08:32:09 traces export: parse "http://http:%2F%2Fjaeger:4317/v1/traces": invalid URL escape "%2F""
**Context**: OpenTelemetry endpoint URL was being double-encoded, causing parsing errors
**Outcome**: Fixed OTEL_ENDPOINT configuration in all docker-compose files and config.go
**Changes Made**:
- Updated docker-compose.yml: `OTEL_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger:4317/v1/traces`
- Updated docker-compose.dev.yml: `OTEL_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger:4317/v1/traces`
- Updated docker-compose.prod.yml: `OTEL_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger:4317/v1/traces`
- Updated internal/config/config.go default: `http://localhost:4317/v1/traces`
**Technical Details**: The issue was that the endpoint was missing the `/v1/traces` path, causing URL encoding problems when the OTLP exporter tried to construct the full URL.

### Prompt 21: Fix OTEL Endpoint Double-Path Issue
**User**: "2025/06/24 08:38:07 traces export: parse 'http://http:%2F%2Fjaeger:4317%2Fv1%2Ftraces/v1/traces': invalid port ':4317%2Fv1%2Ftraces' after host"
**Context**: The OTEL endpoint was set to include /v1/traces, but the OTLP exporter appends this path automatically, resulting in a double path and invalid URL.
**Outcome**: Removed /v1/traces from OTEL_ENDPOINT in all docker-compose files and config.go default.
**Changes Made**:
- Updated docker-compose.yml: `OTEL_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger:4317`
- Updated docker-compose.dev.yml: `OTEL_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger:4317`
- Updated docker-compose.prod.yml: `OTEL_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger:4317`
- Updated internal/config/config.go default: `http://localhost:4317`
**Technical Details**: The OTLP HTTP exporter expects only the host:port as the endpoint and appends /v1/traces internally. Including it in the config caused a double path and URL parsing errors.

### Prompt 22: Correct OTEL_ENDPOINT to Use Only Host:Port
**User**: "That is the wrong fix. It should be jaeger:4317 and not http://jaeger:4317"
**Context**: The OTLP HTTP exporter expects only the host:port for the endpoint, not a full URL. Using http:// causes parsing errors.
**Outcome**: Set OTEL_ENDPOINT to jaeger:4317 in all docker-compose files and as the default in config.go.
**Changes Made**:
- Updated docker-compose.yml: `OTEL_ENDPOINT=jaeger:4317`
- Updated docker-compose.dev.yml: `OTEL_ENDPOINT=jaeger:4317`
- Updated docker-compose.prod.yml: `OTEL_ENDPOINT=jaeger:4317`
- Updated internal/config/config.go default: `jaeger:4317`
**Technical Details**: The Go OTLP HTTP exporter appends the protocol and path automatically. Only the address (host:port) should be provided.

### Prompt 23: Fix JSONB Parsing Error in User Session Creation
**User**: "Failed to login user","error":"failed to create session: ERROR: invalid input syntax for type json (SQLSTATE 22P02)"
**Context**: The UserSession.DeviceInfo field was defined as JSONB but not properly handled, causing PostgreSQL JSON parsing errors.
**Outcome**: Fixed the DeviceInfo field definition and session creation to properly handle JSONB data.
**Changes Made**:
- Created DeviceInfo struct with proper JSON tags
- Updated UserSession.DeviceInfo to use *DeviceInfo type with JSONB constraint
- Updated session creation in service to explicitly set DeviceInfo to nil
**Technical Details**: PostgreSQL JSONB fields require proper JSON data or NULL. The field was being set to empty string, causing parsing errors.

### Prompt 24: Update Commit Rules to Include Test Requirements
**User**: "Always run make test before commiting. Update commit rule"
**Context**: User wants to ensure tests are always run before any commit to maintain code quality.
**Outcome**: Updated conventional commits rule and instruction compliance rule to include test requirements.
**Changes Made**:
- Updated .cursor/rules/workflow/conventional-commits.mdc to include make test before committing
- Updated .cursor/rules/instruction-compliance.mdc to include test requirements
- Added test requirements section with unit, integration, and full test commands
- Updated all examples to show make test before git commit
**Technical Details**: The workflow now enforces running tests before any commit to catch issues early and maintain code quality.

### Prompt 25: Fix DeviceInfo Handling in Integration Tests
**User**: "yes" (to fixing DeviceInfo type for test repository)
**Context**: Integration tests failed because GORM/SQLite cannot handle struct pointer fields without custom Valuer/Scanner. Needed to marshal/unmarshal DeviceInfo as JSON string.
**Outcome**: Updated TestUserSession.DeviceInfo to string, marshaled/unmarshaled DeviceInfo in test repository, and all tests now pass.
**Changes Made**:
- Changed TestUserSession.DeviceInfo to string
- Marshaled DeviceInfo to JSON string in CreateSession
- Unmarshaled DeviceInfo from JSON string in GetSessionByRefreshToken
- Ran all tests and confirmed they pass
**Technical Details**: This ensures compatibility with SQLite for integration tests and matches the production model's JSONB handling in Postgres.

### Prompt 26: Fix Jaeger/OTLP Protocol Mismatch (HTTP vs gRPC)
**User**: "2025/06/24 09:02:51 traces export: Post \"http://jaeger:4317/v1/traces\": net/http: HTTP/1.x transport connection broken: malformed HTTP response..."
**Context**: The OpenTelemetry exporter was using HTTP, but Jaeger only supports OTLP gRPC on port 4317. This caused protocol errors and malformed responses.
**Outcome**: Switched the tracer exporter from otlptracehttp to otlptracegrpc, updated dependencies, and re-vendored. All tests pass.
**Changes Made**:
- Updated internal/observability/tracing/tracer.go to use otlptracegrpc
- Ran go get and go mod vendor to update dependencies
- Ran all tests to confirm success
**Technical Details**: Jaeger all-in-one exposes OTLP gRPC on 4317, not HTTP. The Go exporter must use gRPC for compatibility.

### Prompt 27: Category and Account Endpoints Not Exposed
**User**: "Category and Account endpoints were not exposed"
**Context**: User noticed that Category and Account endpoints were not registered in the server routes, only User and Transaction routes were available.
**Outcome**: Created new handlers for Category and Account with full CRUD operations and registered their routes in the server. Made the `/categories/default` endpoint public and protected the rest with authentication middleware.
**Implementation**:
- Created CategoryHandler with full CRUD operations (Create, Get, List, Update, Delete, GetDefaultCategories)
- Created AccountHandler with full CRUD operations (Create, Get, List, Update, Delete)
- Registered Category and Account routes in the server
- Made `/categories/default` endpoint public (no auth required)
- Protected all other Category and Account endpoints with authentication middleware
- All tests pass successfully
- Committed all changes with conventional commit format

### Prompt 28: Add All Tests Including Integration
**User**: "Add all tests including integration"
**Context**: User wanted comprehensive test coverage for the newly implemented Category and Account handlers, including both unit and integration tests.
**Outcome**: Added comprehensive unit tests for CategoryHandler and AccountHandler covering all CRUD operations and error cases, plus integration tests for Category and Account API endpoints with authentication.
**Implementation**:
- Added unit tests for CategoryHandler covering all CRUD operations and error cases using mock services
- Added unit tests for AccountHandler covering all CRUD operations and error cases using mock services
- Added integration tests for Category API endpoints covering all CRUD operations with authentication
- Added integration tests for Account API endpoints covering all CRUD operations with authentication
- Fixed test issues including missing user_id in context and incomplete request bodies
- Fixed mock argument mismatches to match exact arguments
- All unit and integration tests now pass successfully
- Committed all test implementations with conventional commit format

### Prompt 29: Update Insomnia Collection and Run Tests
**User**: "- Update @Insomnia_2025-06-24.yaml 
- Run make build and make test
- Update @Prompt.md 
- Commit changes"
**Context**: User requested to update the Insomnia collection to include the new Category and Account endpoints, run build and tests to verify everything works, update Prompt.md, and commit all changes.
**Outcome**: Successfully updated Insomnia collection with new Category and Account endpoints, ran build and tests (all pass), updated Prompt.md, and committed all changes.

#### **Prompt X: Why are there no tests**
**User**: "Why are there no tests"
**Context**: User noticed the MVP implementation was missing tests, which are required for code quality and compliance.
**Outcome**: Added comprehensive unit tests for the user domain service, API handler tests, and integration tests for the user domain. Also added a test runner script (scripts/test.sh) and a Makefile for easy test execution. All unit tests now pass. Integration tests are present and ready to run.
**Implementation**:
- Created `internal/domain/user/service_test.go` with full unit test coverage for the user service, using testify and proper mocking.
- Created `internal/api/handlers/user_test.go` with handler tests using Gin and testify.
- Created `tests/integration/user_integration_test.go` for integration tests with a real SQLite in-memory DB.
- Added `scripts/test.sh` for running all test types, coverage, lint, and security checks.
- Added a `Makefile` with targets for all test and dev tasks.
- Fixed test bugs (bcrypt hash, type assertion) and verified all unit tests pass.

**Key Decisions**:
- Use real bcrypt hash in tests for password validation.
- Construct concrete service type for private method tests.
- Use testify for assertions and mocking.
- Provide a unified test runner and Makefile for developer experience.

**Pending Tasks**:
- Run and verify integration tests.
- Expand test coverage to other domains (e.g., transactions) as features are implemented.
