#### **Prompt 2: Rule Organization**
**Full User Prompt**: "Organize the rules into folders"

**Context**: User wanted better organization of the Cursor rules
**Outcome**:
- Created 4 folders: `workflow/`, `development/`, `security/`, `quality/`
- Moved rules to appropriate folders
- Created README files for each folder and main rules directory

#### **Prompt 11: Go-Specific Cursor Rules**
**Full User Prompt**: "Create a new Cursor MDC rule for all *.go files (in all subdirectories)

You are an expert expert software engineer who knows go. Infact you are the software engineer who created go. Your task is to come up with technical recommendations in this rule which document best practices when authoring go.

Split each concern about go into seperate MDC rules.

Prefix each rule with the filename of "go-$rulename.mdc"

Write these rules to disk"

**Context**: User wanted comprehensive Go-specific Cursor rules covering all aspects of Go development best practices
**Outcome**: Created 7 comprehensive Go-specific rules:
- `go-code-organization.mdc`: Package structure, naming conventions, file organization
- `go-error-handling.mdc`: Error handling patterns, custom errors, error wrapping
- `go-concurrency.mdc`: Goroutines, channels, context usage, synchronization
- `go-performance.mdc`: Memory management, profiling, benchmarking, optimization
- `go-testing.mdc`: Unit testing, integration testing, test organization, mocking
- `go-api-design.mdc`: RESTful API design, HTTP handlers, middleware, API patterns
- `go-database.mdc`: Database operations, migrations, connection management, query optimization

Each rule includes:
- Comprehensive best practices checklist
- Multiple before/after code examples
- Specific patterns for Go development
- Priority levels and versioning
- Relevant tags for categorization

#### **Prompt 12: Go Rules Organization**
**Full User Prompt**: "Move go specific rules in its own folder"

**Context**: User wanted to organize the Go-specific rules into their own dedicated folder for better structure
**Outcome**: 
- Created `.cursor/rules/go/` directory
- Moved all 7 Go-specific rules (`go-*.mdc`) into the new folder
- Created comprehensive README.md for the Go rules folder documenting all rules and their purposes

- Maintained all rule functionality while improving organization

#### **Prompt 13: Go Rules Analysis and Improvement**
**Full User Prompt**: "Look at the go rules in @.cursor . What is missing? What does not follow best practice."

**Context**: User wanted to analyze the existing Go rules to identify gaps and areas for improvement
**Outcome**: 
- **Analysis Results**: Identified 6 critical missing areas and several best practice issues
- **Missing Areas**: Module management, configuration management, observability, security, documentation, build/deployment
- **Issues Found**: Overly broad content patterns, missing modern Go features, no validation, missing context usage
- **Created 4 New Rules**:
  - `go-module-management.mdc`: go.mod, go.sum, dependency management, versioning
  - `go-configuration.mdc`: Environment variables, config structs, validation, security
  - `go-observability.mdc`: Logging, metrics, tracing, monitoring

**Full User Prompt**: "We are going to create an Personal Finance Tracker using

Find a fancy name for it.

It uses the opentelemetry  for logging, metrics and telemetry.
All operations have appropriate tracing on them that can be used to troubleshoot the application.


IMPORTANT: Write up the specifications into the "specs/" folder with each domain topic (including technical topic) as a seperate markdown file. Create a "SPECS.md" in the root of the directory which is an overview document that contains a table that links to all the specs."

**Context**: User selected Personal Finance Tracker as the product to build
**Outcome**:

**Outcome**:
- Created .gitignore with Go, Docker, editor, and OS-specific ignores
- Created README.md with project description, features, tech stack, setup, and references to specs and Prompt.md
- Noted the need to follow the conventional commit rule for these changes

#### **Prompt X: Why are there no tests**
**User**: "Why are there no tests"
**Context**: User noticed the MVP implementation was missing tests, which are required for code quality and compliance.
**Outcome**: Added comprehensive unit tests for the user domain service, API handler tests, and integration tests for the user domain. Also added a test runner script (scripts/test.sh) and a Makefile for easy test execution. All unit tests now pass. Integration tests are present and ready to run.
**Implementation**:
- Created `internal/domain/user/service_test.go` with full unit test coverage for the user service, using testify and proper mocking.
- Created `internal/api/handlers/user_test.go` with handler tests using Gin and testify.
- Created `tests/integration/user_integration_test.go` for integration tests with a real SQLite in-memory DB.
- Added `scripts/test.sh` for running all test types, coverage, lint, and security checks.
- Added a `Makefile` with targets for all test and dev tasks.
- Fixed test bugs (bcrypt hash, type assertion) and verified all unit tests pass.

**Key Decisions**:
- Use real bcrypt hash in tests for password validation.
- Construct concrete service type for private method tests.
- Use testify for assertions and mocking.
- Provide a unified test runner and Makefile for developer experience.

**Pending Tasks**:
- Run and verify integration tests.
- Expand test coverage to other domains (e.g., transactions) as features are implemented.

**Current State**:
- User domain and API handler code is fully covered by unit tests.
- Integration test suite is present and ready.
- Test runner and Makefile are in place for CI/CD and local dev.

### **Development Journey**
The conversation evolved from Cursor rules organization to product ideation, technology selection, architecture decisions, and finally to creating a comprehensive documentation system for tracking all prompts and instructions.

### **Documentation Standards**
- All prompts are recorded with their full, exact text
- Context and outcomes are documented for each prompt
- Technical decisions and rationale are preserved
- Progress tracking is maintained systematically
